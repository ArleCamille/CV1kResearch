The audio format used by CV1000 is called YAMAHA AMM (AMusement Machine compression), which reuses the
MPEG packet frame format but uses a significantly different header structure from the vanilla MP2.

The header for a YAMAHA AMM consists of the following:
AAAAAAAA AAAABCCX DDDDEEFF GGHHIIIJ
- A (12 bits): sync word. Like the vanilla MP2, it should always be 1.
- B (1 bit): AFAIK it seems to act like the vanilla MP2 version code, for which 1 is MPEG1 and 2 is MPEG2.
             MAME notes B=0 as MPEG 2.5, but judging from the sampling rate table, it is actually MPEG2.
- C (2 bits): MPEG layer. Like vanilla MP2, 01=L3, 10=L2 and 11=L1.
- X (1 bit): unused.
- D (4 bits): number of "full packets" in the frame. AMM seems to further divide the frame into atoms
              called "packets." D=0b1100 (12) means there are 36 small frames in the frame,
              corresponding to 1152 samples in L2 and L3. (384 samples in L1? I dunno for this
              combination.)
- E (2 bits): sampling rate index. Same meaning as in the same layer of vanilla MP2.
- F (2 bits): Additional small frames to pad the full packets.
- G (2 bits): stereo mode. Same meaning as in MP2. (00: stereo, 01: joint stereo, 10: dual channel,
              11: mono)
- H (2 bits): stereo mode extension which only applies to E=01 (joint stereo).
- I (3 bits): parameter index. This directly decides the "total band count" instead of relying on the
              bitrate and sampling rate for quantization.

There is nowhere which specifies the bitrate. Therefore, we cannot expect where the next frame lies.
Perhaps we should instead directly decode the audio data to PCM?

# MPEG2 header
# b1 * 11 (sync)
# b10 (mpeg v2)
# b1 (not protected)
# ???? bitrate
# 10 (16khz sample rate)
# 0 (no padding)
# 0 (private bit)
# 11 (mono)
# 00 (mode extension)
# 0 (copyright)
# 1 (original)
# 00 (emphasis?)
